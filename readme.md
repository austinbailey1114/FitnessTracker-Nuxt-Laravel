## Tools
Fitness Tracker uses Nuxt (Vue) for a reactive front-end, which connects to a separate Laravel back-end API. I used JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure security of data exchange between front-end and back-end.
## Features
* Live search of USDA Food Database of 8000 foods
    * Track daily macronutrients by saving foods
    * Graphics to visualize progress
* Track weight lifting and bodyweight data
    * Graphs and Tables to show progress over time
    * Users can edit their data
